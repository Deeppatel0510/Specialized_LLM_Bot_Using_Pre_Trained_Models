Why Asset Tracking Software?








Establishing a hierarchical asset structure is critical for asset tracking. It is impossible to assess asset reliability and maintainability without understanding how assets interact with one another. Asset management success boils down to one thing: Asset tracking. You won’t be able to make data-driven decisions and reduce failures if you don’t track asset maintenance history adequately.
TeroTAM is a cutting-edge asset tracking option that is simple to use and puts all you need to know in one place. Bye-bye, spreadsheets that aren’t up to date. Our asset tracking solution is cloud-based and mobile-friendly, allowing your field crew to get the information they need quickly, as well as a web interface for those in the office to perform comprehensive asset monitoring reporting.


Spreadsheets are no longer necessary


Managing the asset and keeping their records the old-fashioned way with spreadsheets is really a cumbersome and time-consuming process. With asset tracking software you can manage every record and update of assets in a paperless manner. Just use the software with any handy device and get the information you need about your asset anytime, anywhere.




There’s no need to go through your files to obtain asset information
Digging for hours in files and ledgers is no longer needed. The information is automatically recorded or documented by the TeroTAM asset tracking software and can be reviewed later. It also gives you up-to-date information.




No more Human errors
Manually documenting and tracking assets have chances of human errors, but the asset tracking software, on the other hand, ensures that the assets that are being tracked are not duplicated. As a result, you can rest assured that your data is correct.




Accurate information on the fingertip
Because the software automatically documents the assets, you will have access to the most up-to-date information on the assets. You’ll also learn about all of the assets and where they’re located.














QR Codes make Inventory Tracking Simple


The QR code, or quick response code, is a type of barcode that saves data for use as a locator, identifier, or tracker that leads to a website or application. It can quickly scan this QR code with your Android handset, and with just a single scan, you can acquire all the information you need about the relevant stock item whose QR code you scanned.




Smartphone tracking with a single click
QR codes are simple to read with an Android phone and do not require any specific equipment, making the process simpler and faster..




Scanning in all directions
QR codes can be scanned from all sides, making them easier to read and reducing background interference.




All Asset information with a single scan
QR codes are used to track information such as product names, prices, serial numbers, lots dates, inventory item in and out data, and other data related to inventory goods.


RFID technology can help you increase efficiency


Routine asset tracking operations, such as asset storage, order status tracking, paper processing, sorting of different assets and documents, loading and unloading, and other dispatch and customer service-related chores, can all be done more efficiently with an RFID tag.




Asset information is available right now
Gives you immediate access to the inventory database and the 24-hour visibility you need to keep track of all in-and-out transactions in the warehouse.

The Most common Brain Teaser for Asset Tracking







How does Asset Tracking work?The ability to issue a unique identification number to each item you need to keep track of is a basic aspect of asset tracking. By scanning an item’s barcode using a handheld scanner, you can trace its movement as it passes through different hands and moves around.
How do you track the Asset Movement?For asset tracking, there are three basic types of technology: Barcodes or QR codes, radio frequency identification (RFID), and global positioning systems (GPS): Tags that are currently active.
What is the Purpose of Asset Tracking?Asset tracking gives you a high-level view of the functioning of your company’s physical areas, such as the office, warehouse, and storage. This is significant because it allows you to uncover critical relationships in how these industries utilize assets in order to streamline corporate operations.
What is RFID Asset Tracking?RFID asset tracking, in its most basic form, is a method of automating the management and location of physical assets. It operates by storing data on an RFID tag and attaching it to a specific object. This information can range from a person’s name to their condition, amount, and location.
How does Asset Tracking help maintain compliance?Asset tracking systems can be used to conduct audits. Frequent audits filter asset data and highlight issues that need to be addressed. This allows a company to stay up to date on the latest compliance regulations in the market.

Why Preventive Maintenance Software?








A preventive maintenance solution makes sure that on an ongoing basis, maintenance can be scheduled automatically for assets, plant, and equipment and allocated to a chosen contractor in a seamless and automated manner. A monthly maintenance check on one asset can necessitate a quarterly maintenance check on another. The recommended contractor is automatically given the project task to complete when it arises. This usually begins with a job request form and is a component of your work order software.
By identifying possible concerns early and resolving them before they become costly repairs, preventative maintenance can help prevent maintenance issues. Frequent inspections can aid in spotting flaws, worn components, and other problems before they worsen. Also, by ensuring that your equipment is performing at its best, planned preventative maintenance can help extend the life of your equipment. In the long term, routine maintenance can save you money by avoiding pricey repairs or replacements.

Why You Need Workflow Management Software?

Drill down into the individual interactions that make up your broader work processes or zoom out to see the big picture. Identify bottlenecks and automation opportunities. Boost the speed of your operations without putting more pressure on your employees. Instead of slapping the whip, look for efficiency.

Define Goals and Expectations in advance


Save your Time and Energy from discussing unclear goals. Define all the answers in advance for What exactly are the deliverables? Who is in charge of each piece of work? When does each task have to be completed? Setting goals helps team members understand how their work contributes to the company’s goals and operations. Set communication standards in advance, provide everyone clarity on higher-level goals and encourage team engagement to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Improved Accountability and Efficiency

Workflow management system reduces errors and eliminates bottlenecks, resulting in increased process efficiency and enhanced accountability, and gives operations more clarity with transparent procedures within the whole organization. Get maximum out of your team and their potential with streamlined efforts and work planning.

Frequently Asked Question


The Most Common Brain Teaser for Document Management System







What is Document Management Software?Document management software facilitates the storing, accessing, managing, controlling, and tracking of digital documents as well as electronic versions of information that have been scanned from paper and stored as digital documents. The sharing, managing, and organizing of digital files can be accomplished with the aid of very basic document management systems, or they can be an intricate component of an enterprise content management system with advanced features to support information governance, records management, and other processes.
How do businesses need Document Management System?A document management system establishes a central area to gather and preserve the information that is centered around documents in your company. This makes locating current versions of documents and information simpler and frees up workers’ time so they can concentrate on their jobs rather than searching through several silos and repositories for bits of paper or digital assets. Additional features are offered by certain document management systems to improve security, document tracking, and sharing.
What are the Top 5 Functions of a Document Management System?The top five functions of a DMS are concurrency, security, backup and recovery, integrity, and data descriptions.
What are the Key Factors to keep in mind while choosing a Document Management Solution?For content to be accessible across a variety of business programs, such as Salesforce and SAP, it is crucial to take into account the integration and extension capabilities of other line-of-business systems when picking document management software. User interaction with the system must also be taken into account. Whether it’s through web browsers, desktop computers, or mobile devices, different people prefer to work in different ways.
Why Cloud-based Document Management System is beneficial?A cloud-based document management system has the benefit of putting less of a strain on IT in terms of infrastructure, maintenance, scalability, redundancy, and security. Automatic updates are made. Very affordable, long-term archival storage is a perk of some cloud-based document management solutions. End-to-end, fully managed content services are offered via Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions.

Testimonial
Paradigm ShiftWith an easy to operate system and user-friendly Interface of TeroTAM, we integrated more than 200+ outlets operational within PAN India for 2+ years. This software enabled us to manage almost everything with a centralized dashboard, by sitting in one place, manage priorities and analyze all the key performance indicators with prolonged analytics. We are expecting to use TeroTAM for a long horizon with more advanced upgraded software in the era of growing new technologies.
